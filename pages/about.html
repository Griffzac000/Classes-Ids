        <h2>What is Fashion?</h2>
        <section><p>Fashion is <strong> perspective </strong>, but it's deeper than just that, it's what you make its <br>
            people cannot tell what fshion is because to the fashion could be something completely different.</p>
            <p>But of course there are categories to fashion like: <br>
            <ul id="nav-bar-list">
                <li>Streetwear</li>
                <li>Classic</li>
                <li>Grunge</li>
                <li>Formal Wear</li>
                <li>Casual</li>
            </ul>
            are the main types of fashion that you would usually see.</p>
            <p>
                There are  many other different and unique types of fashion that aren't listed here, but fashion is what you make of it, <br>
                it is what you feel comfortable in and how you express yourself. Don't let anyone define how you dress because it is a leaning experience <br>
                that develops through time.
